# Email/Password Signup Functionality Test

## What was added:

1. **Firebase Configuration Updates** (`firebase.js`):
   - Added `createUserWithEmailAndPassword` import
   - Exported the function for use in components

2. **Signup Page Updates** (`app/signup/page.js`):
   - Added email/password form fields (email, password, confirmPassword, displayName)
   - Added `handleEmailSignup` function that:
     - Validates form fields
     - Creates user with email/password using Firebase Auth
     - Handles various error cases (email already in use, weak password, etc.)
     - Integrates with existing role selection and school joining flow
   - Updated UI to show both Google and email signup options
   - Added form validation (password confirmation, minimum length)
   - Updated `handleBackToRole` to clear email/password fields

## Features:

### Email/Password Signup Form:
- Full Name field
- Email Address field  
- Password field (minimum 6 characters)
- Confirm Password field
- Form validation (passwords must match)
- Error handling for various Firebase Auth errors

### Integration with Existing Flow:
- Works with role selection (admin, teacher, student)
- Integrates with school joining process
- Supports both immediate join and manual approval workflows
- Maintains existing Google signup functionality

### Error Handling:
- Email already in use
- Invalid email format
- Weak password
- Password confirmation mismatch
- Missing required fields

## Testing:

1. Navigate to `/signup`
2. Select a role (admin, teacher, or student)
3. Fill out the email/password form:
   - Full Name: "Test User"
   - Email: "test@example.com"
   - Password: "password123"
   - Confirm Password: "password123"
4. Click "Sign Up with Email"
5. Follow the role-specific flow (join code, create school, etc.)

## Notes:

- Email/password signup creates users without profile pictures (empty photoURL)
- The functionality integrates seamlessly with the existing authentication flow
- Both Google and email signup methods are available
- The form only appears after selecting a role
- All existing functionality (school creation, join codes, etc.) remains intact
